# Conceptual Task: - Architecture Design and Problem-Solving

## 1. Real-time Audio Synchronization
**Objective:** Ensure both singers hear the combined output in sync.

**Solution:**
- **Use WebRTC:** This library is ideal for real-time communication and provides low-latency audio streaming.
- **Audio Mixing:** Each client's audio stream is captured and sent to the server, which mixes the streams and sends the combined output back to both clients. This ensures synchronization.
- **Synchronization Mechanism:** Use timestamps or sequence numbers to align audio packets from both users.

## 2. Backend Integration
**Objective:** Determine the data exchanged between clients and the server.

**Solution:**
- **Signaling Server:** Handles the initial connection setup and coordinates the exchange of session descriptions and ICE candidates between peers.
- **Media Server:** Receives audio streams from both clients, mixes them, and sends the combined stream back to each client.

**Data Flow:**
1. **Connection Setup:**
   - User A and User B connect to the signaling server.
   - The server exchanges SDP (Session Description Protocol) offers/answers and ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates.
2. **Audio Streaming:**
   - Both clients send their audio streams to the media server.
   - The media server mixes the streams and sends the combined output back to each client.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions
**Objective:** Address technical challenges such as latency and echo.

**Solution:**
- **Latency:**
  - **Buffering and Jitter Handling:** Implement jitter buffers to handle variations in packet arrival times.
  - **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:** Adjust the bitrate based on network conditions to reduce latency.
- **Echo:**
  - **Echo Cancellation:** Use WebRTC's built-in echo cancellation features.
  - **Feedback Control:** Implement mechanisms to prevent audio feedback loops.
- **Synchronization:**
  - **Network Time Protocol (NTP):** Use NTP to synchronize clocks across devices.
  - **Timestamping:** Timestamp audio packets to ensure proper sequencing.
